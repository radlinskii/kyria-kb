# Kyria KB

This repo holds hardware and software custom solutions I used to personalize my [kyria](https://blog.splitkb.com/blog/introducing-the-kyria) rev2.1 keyboard.

The `qmk_keymap` directory holds files used by [QMK](https://qmk.fm) that you can use to create a firmware for kyria keyboard.

In `3d_models` directory I shared files (stls, and fusion360) used to 3D print cases and tenting kits.

In `images` folder you can find previews of the 3D models, pictures I created to use in OLED animation, and images of the keyboard.
